### Intro

This repository consists of the TMDb dataset and a Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of the dataset. It looks to answer a few questions:
  1. Which genre of movies is the most profitable?
  2. Is there a discernable difference between keywords associated with flops vs successes?
  3. Are box office successes rated higher?
  4. Is there a temporal component to flops vs successes? 
  5. Can we predict box office flops?

The TMDb dataset was chosen for this analysis as it provides a good volume and variety of data to showcase data engineering and feature engineering, as well as the potential to build a predictive model to predict movie flops. 

### Prerequisites

Apart from the libraries in the Anaconda distribution, this reportsitory makes use of the WordCloud library to plot a simple word cloud. [Linked](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/wordcloud-python) is a good tutorial on how to install and use WordCloud library in your own analyses. To install the WordCloud library, use the below:

`$ pip install wordcloud` or `$ conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud`

### Usage

This repository is primarily to highlight skills learned in the Udacity Advanced Data Science Nanodegree. As such, you can clone this repo to investigate the Jupyter Notebook in greater detail.
